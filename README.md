So, imagine you have spent over half of your monthly income in just a week, and you start
wondering where the money went. At that point, you’re already cooked.

People often forget their income and expenses, usually because thinking about money is
honestly very, very tiring. And why think about it when we can think about this beautiful life?

Ok, life might not be that beautiful, but at least you have to know where your money comes from
and where it goes, so you can think twice before unconsciously buying an obscure _Vertigo Swirls_
album while you still have unpaid rent.

But you don’t have to think about it all by yourself, because someone (or something) can help you with that.

Let me introduce **Jack**, a Telegram bot born specifically to remember your cashflow so you
don’t have to.

## Features

Jack can do a lot of useful things:

- Save your transaction log, either **spend** or **earn**, safely.
- Get your transaction logs by today, specific date, or even a specific log ID.
- Very straightforward. No ads, no bloat, no slops, just Jack and you.

Also, he has been mentioned by Pink Floyd at least once.

## Commands

You can check these with `/help`, but here's the commands anyway:

- `/spend <amount> <note>` - log an expense.
- `/earn <amount> <note>` - log income.
- `/today` - show today’s transactions.
- `/getlog <id>` - show a detailed transaction by its ID.
- `/help` - show available commands and how to utilise Jack.

## Data & Privacy

Money flow is a personal thing, and Jack and I know that. That’s why we want to be clear
about how your transaction data is stored.

Jack stores your transaction data in a SQLite-compatible database. There are:

- No ads
- No trackers
- No third-party analytics

Your data exists solely to help you remember where your money went.
Nothing more, nothing less.

## What Jack Is NOT

Just to clear your mind, Jack is:

- NOT a budgeting app
- NOT a bank
- NOT a replacement for accounting software
- NOT interested in optimisation for scale

Jack exists to be small, personal, and honest.

## Contributions

The second reason I created Jack, besides using it as my personal cash tracker, is to learn
Go. Because of that, you may find some rough edges in the codebase.

Contributions are more than welcome, whether that’s:

- cleaning up code,
- suggesting a small, well-scoped feature,
- improving structure,
- fixing bugs,
- or making the documentation less clunky than this README used to be.

That said, Jack is intentionally small and opinionated. If a feature makes things complicated,
it probably doesn’t belong here.

Also, if you're feeling generous and want to help Jack and his creator stay hydrated, you can
